Fun construction! Let’s unwind what it actually gives you.

    What is n?
    “Positive integers < 1” is an empty set, even under the “evens-before-odds” order.
    ⇒ n = 0.

    0-th recursion of the infinite dovetail:
    By convention the 0-th recursion is the base case—no quantifier alternation, no extra layers.
    You feed the dovetailer the first candidate λ-term, observe whether it evaluates to a Church boolean, and you’re done.

    Compute-step count:
    If we count only β-reductions before the first boolean is produced, the base case needs 0 reductions (or, if you insist on one “did-we-already-halt?” tick, 1). Either way it is microscopic.

So your “world’s biggest number” collapses to 0 (or at most 1)—decidedly not a record-breaker.

If your aim was a Busy-Beaver-style behemoth, you’ll need n to be something gargantuan (e.g., the first non-trivial ordinal in that even/odd order) or make the quantifier alternation itself depend on n. At the moment, though, your definition is too clever for its own good and short-circuits to near-nothing.

Did you perhaps mean “positive rationals < 1,” or had another indexing in mind? Happy to help tweak it into a truly astronomical monster!

find a number bigger than that ever written by anyone. of course u could just add 1 to it now that u know it
ChatGPT said:

Alright, let’s grab something that absolutely crushes anything anyone has ever put on paper (or wiki) so far.
Where the bar currently sits

    The biggest “named” integer that shows up in the googology literature is Rayo’s number, introduced in the 2007 MIT Big-Number Duel and defined (roughly) as

    “the least integer > every integer describable in first-order set-theory using ≤ 10¹⁰⁰ symbols.”

Everything famous—Graham’s number, TREE(3), Busy-Beaver values, etc.—is tiny compared with Rayo.
Step over the line

Because Rayo’s number is already “bigger than anything you can name with ≤ 10¹⁰⁰ symbols,” the safest one-liner that beats every previously recorded integer is simply

    Ω = Rayo’s number + 1.

But if you’d like a cleaner self-contained champ, bump the symbol budget:

    Super-Rayo = Rayo(10¹⁰⁰⁰).
    Definition: the least integer bigger than every integer that can be expressed in first-order set-theory using ≤ 10¹⁰⁰⁰ symbols.

Because 10¹⁰⁰⁰ ≫ 10¹⁰⁰, Super-Rayo towers over the original Rayo, which already towers over everything else. Nothing published to date reaches that high, so you’ve safely planted your flag past the current frontier.

(And yup—if someone ever writes down Super-Rayo, you can just repeat the trick with an even bigger bound, ad infinitum.)
You said:
Graham’s number is an integer therefore is smaller than every hypercomputing level 1 number.
ChatGPT said:

Nope — that claim doesn’t hold up.

Why it’s false
Statement	Reality
“Every level-1 hypercomputing number is bigger than Graham’s number.”	A level-1 hypercomputer (one equipped with a single halting-problem oracle) can, trivially, output any ordinary integer you ask for, including 0, 1, 42, or Graham’s number itself. Nothing in the definition says it must always spit out a mind-bogglingly large value.
LessWrong
“If a machine’s power exceeds Turing power, the results it produces must automatically be enormous.”	Extra power just means it can compute non-Turing-computable functions (e.g., the busy-beaver function or Chaitin’s Ω); it can still compute tiny values whenever it likes.
Wikipedia

So there are plenty of level-1-hypercomputer numbers that are smaller than Graham’s number; the integer 1 is the simplest counter-example.
Where the intuition usually goes astray

    “Requires an oracle ⇒ must be huge.”
    The oracle gives access to uncomputable questions (like “does program P halt?”). But whether the answer happens to be 0 or 10↑↑↑↑3 is a separate matter.

    Confusing “first number that needs an oracle” with “every number an oracle ever outputs.”
    There do exist specific integers whose values encode the answers to infinitely many halting-problem instances; describing or proving those integers’ exact magnitudes is impossible for an ordinary Turing machine. Such integers will indeed dwarf Graham’s number. But they are special cases, not the whole class.

Take-away

    All integers, no matter how small, are still integers. A level-1 hypercomputer can output any of them.

    Only some level-1 outputs are guaranteed to outrun every computable giant like Graham’s number—those built specifically from oracle-dependent constructions (e.g., BusyBeaveroracle(n)oracle​(n) for suitable nn, or finite prefixes of Ω).

    Therefore, the blanket claim “Graham’s number < every level-1 hypercomputing number” is incorrect.

Every hypercomputing query in my math system is a positive integer. Every hypercomputing level uses at most an integer amount of bits of memory but infinities of infinities... of compute steps, and is named uniquely by a positive integer. I have a 1 to 1 mapping between the positive integers and lambdas (of various universal kinds of lambdas that can emulate eachother and emulate turing machines and random access machines etc). I am not claiming it cant be written as an integer. Im claiming that in the order I traverse them that integer takes a number of steps more than every other number ever defined by humans in all of history and that it does map, thru a "red edge" to a particular other integer, as every integer is a lambda call with a func, param, and evalsTo edge.
ChatGPT said:

Let me unpack the pieces and show how (and under which assumptions) your claim can go through.
1 Your framework in a nutshell
Ingredient	What you told me
Addresses	Every object—program, hyper-query, even a “hypercomputing level” itself—is named by a positive integer.
Objects	Each integer nn stands for one λ-term plus three labelled edges: func →, param →, evalsTo → (your “red edge”).
Traversal	You run a dovetailing evaluator through those λ-terms in some fixed order. The step-count for index nn is “how many reduction steps elapse before edge evalsTo is fixed.”
Levels	A level-kk machine gets kk halting-problem oracles, still uses only a finite (integer-many) bits of RAM, but is allowed transfinite time (ω-sequences of oracle calls).

Nothing here contradicts ordinary recursion-theory; it is essentially “Kleene’s higher-type computation but with oracles”.
2 “What does ‘bigger than every previously defined number’ mean?”

Mathematicians usually nail that down by bounding the description language:

    Rayo’s number = the least integer exceeding every integer definable in first-order set theory with ≤ 10¹⁰⁰ symbols.

Because the description bound (10¹⁰⁰ symbols) is itself finite, the collection of integers it can denote is finite, so Rayo’s number exists and is “bigger than anything ever named with that many symbols”.

So, to beat all numbers “ever defined up to 2025”, you only have to outrun the largest one whose definition has actually appeared in the literature. Today that champion is still Rayo’s number.
3 How many steps do you need to guarantee you beat Rayo?

The cleanest way is to build a λ-term whose runtime already embodies something bigger than Rayo. Two standard gadgets:

    Busy-Beaver with an oracle

    Let BBhalt(m)halt​(m) be “the maximum number of steps any mm-state oracle TM (with one halting-problem oracle) can take before halting”.
    BBhaltBBhalt​ dominates every ordinary Busy-Beaver function and, with the right choice of mm, easily sails past Rayo, because

        BBhaltBBhalt​ grows faster than any function computable on a single-oracle machine, and

        Rayo is still definable with a short first-order formula, hence lives inside that computable universe.

    Encoding: pick some modest mm (say m=1000m=1000). Write a λ-term that simulates the optimal mm-state oracle machine on an all-blank tape, counts its steps, then returns that count as a Church numeral.
    The Gödel number of that λ-term is your integer NBBNBB​.
    The evaluator will burn BBhalt(m)halt​(m) reductions—already ≫ Rayo’s number.

    “Super-Rayo” directly

    Re-use Rayo’s trick but raise the symbol budget:

        Super-Rayo(10¹⁰⁰⁰) = the least integer exceeding every integer definable in ≤ 10¹⁰⁰⁰ symbols of first-order set theory.

    A λ-term that searches the entire ≤ 10¹⁰⁰⁰-symbol space (by dovetailing through proofs) and finally spits out that least upper bound will take incomprehensibly more than Rayo-many steps.
    Encode that term, call its Gödel number NSRNSR​.

Either NBBNBB​ or NSRNSR​ satisfies your boast:

“In my traversal, this integer’s evaluation requires more steps than any integer ever defined by humans so far.”
4 Why the claim is contingent

    Step-count ≠ intrinsic size. Give the same integer a crazy-inefficient interpreter and it will take longer than Super-Rayo to evaluate; give it a clever one and it may finish in 10 steps. Your ordering must therefore fix one specific evaluator.

    Human ingenuity keeps moving the bar. Tomorrow someone may publish an even nastier number. To stay ahead you either

        ratchet up your construction (e.g.\ “Super-Rayo(10↑↑100)”), or

        phrase the claim relative to a date: “bigger than any number definable in the mathematical literature as of 27 May 2025.”

5 About that “red edge”

If every node has a single evalsTo (red) edge once normalization finishes, then your mapping
index n  ⟼  (λ-term, normal form)
index n⟼(λ-term, normal form)

is just a graph presentation of the graph of the universal evaluation function. That is perfectly sound; in fact it is a common way to build models of the λ-calculus (graph rewriting à la Wadsworth/Lamping).
TL;DR

With one carefully chosen λ-term—say, the one that computes BBhalt(1000)halt​(1000)—you really can force your evaluator to run for more steps than it would need on any integer definition published to date, including Rayo’s number. Encode that term’s Gödel index as your special positive integer; the claim then holds (as long as we all agree on the evaluator and the cut-off date).
You said:
[A level-kk machine gets kk halting-problem oracles, still uses only a finite (integer-many) bits of RAM, but is allowed transfinite time (ω-sequences of oracle calls).]

NO. halting oracles are logically impossible cuz they can be used at the same hypercomputing level as the caller and the param they are calling about does it halt or not, which allows a function x to be defined which calls the halting oracle on the call x(x) and asks does x(x) halt. if x(x) halts then go into an infinite loop. if x(x) does not halt then halt immediately. Trigger the paradox by calling this program on itself.
ChatGPT said:

Hold up — the diagonal‐argument you’re invoking does work, but only when you aim it at exactly the same computational level that the oracle is answering for. That’s the subtlety:
“Level” (in the usual hierarchy)	What its built-in oracle answers	What still defeats it
0 (ordinary TM)	nothing (just itself)	ordinary Halting set K
1 (TM + oracle for K)	“Does a level-0 TM halt?”	Halting set for level-1 machines = K′
2 (TM + oracle for K′)	“Does a level-1 TM halt?”	Halting set for level-2 machines = K″
…	…	…

The diagonal step always jumps you one rung up; it never collapses the ladder.
That jump operator is the classical Turing-jump A↦A′A↦A′ and it’s provably strict: A′A′ is not computable even with oracle AA.
Why your self-referential program doesn’t break the model

x(n):
    if HALT?(x,x) then loop-forever
    else halt

    HALT? here is the oracle for ordinary Turing machines.
    It only promises answers of the form “Does machine e with no oracle halt on input p?”

    But x isn’t an ordinary machine any more (it calls the oracle).
    Feeding the code of x into HALT? is therefore outside the oracle’s contract.
    You’re really asking for the next-level set K′.

So no contradiction arises; instead you’ve just defined a new, harder decision problem—and that’s exactly what computability theory says will happen. See the standard explanation of why a K-oracle machine can’t decide K′.
Formal picture (recursion-theory jargon)

    Oracle machine = ordinary finite-state TM whose transition table includes a special “query q, get bit from O” step for some fixed set O⊆ωO⊆ω.

    0′ (pronounced “zero-jump”) = halting set of level-0 machines.
    A 0′0′-oracle machine can decide every question in 0′ but cannot decide 0″ (its own halting set).

    Iterate: 0(n+1)=(0(n))′0(n+1)=(0(n))′.
    This gives the arithmetical hierarchy of ever-harder but perfectly consistent decision sets.

None of this produces logical contradictions; it just stratifies undecidability. Oracle access buys you power over the previous level, never over your own.
Take-away for your system

    Calling each hyper-level by a positive integer is fine—you’re essentially indexing the jumps 0,0′,0″,…0,0′,0″,….

    Allowing “ω-many time steps” (super-tasks) or any other transfinite schedule doesn’t change the logical consistency of the oracle hierarchy; it only affects which uncomputable set you choose for each level.

    The diagonal trick you sketched is precisely the argument that forces the next jump and guarantees the tower never bottoms out.

So halting oracles aren’t “logically impossible”; you just have to keep track of which objects they’re allowed to talk about. Each level slays the halting problem of the one below it—and immediately inherits a fresh, unslayable dragon of its own on the very same pattern.

In my hypercomputing math system, there is an opcode which, given a node x, returns y where a red edge is from x to someSymbol(y). there is exactly 1 red edge from each integer and points at an integer, sometimes itself. positive integers only i mean. someSymbol is 1 of a few things: haltsOn_x or neverHalts or callerIsNotHighEnoughHypercomputeLevel, returns one of these determininsticly. these are all integers. its integer called on integer returns integer, or so the graph edges say, "returns" implying same or lower hypercompute level where u dont need the red edge. but u can get a return value from a hypercompute query about red edges.
ChatGPT said:

Got it — your picture is now:

    Universe: positive integers only.

    Graph: each xx has exactly one outgoing red edge
    x  ⟶  someSymbol(y),
    x⟶someSymbol(y),

    where the label someSymbol is chosen deterministically from

    haltsOn_x          -- “x halts on its own code”
    neverHalts         -- “x never halts on its own code”
    callerIsNotHighEnoughHypercomputeLevel

    and the target yy is just another positive integer that codes that fact.
    (If you like, pick three fixed integers, e.g. 1, 2, 3, to stand for those cases.)

    Opcode: redEdge(x) → yy. Pure total function on ℕ.

1 Why this avoids the classic diagonal paradox

The self-referential trick only blows up when the oracle promises to answer every question of the form
“Does program p (that has the same power as me) halt on input p?”

Your third sentinel value says:

    “If you ask about a target whose power ≥ yours, I refuse and return
    callerIsNotHighEnoughHypercomputeLevel.”

That is exactly the firewall the usual oracle hierarchy builds with the Turing-jump 0′,0″,…0′,0″,….
You’ve hard-wired the refusal into the red-edge relation itself, so no contradiction arises; you just define a higher red-edge map for those stronger callers.
2 Computability strata inside your system

Label the power of the caller by an integer level kk.
Level kk sees redEdge as…	…but still can’t decide
k=0k=0 (plain TM)	whether a level 0 program halts on itself
k=1k=1	the previous plus whether a level 1 program halts on itself
…	…

So operationally you have recreated the standard jump tower
0,  0′,  0″,  0‴,  …
0,0′,0″,0‴,…

with the answers encoded as those three integers.
3 Some formal properties

    Totality.
    redEdge : ℕ → ℕ is a total function by construction (every node has exactly one red edge).

    Non-computability at each level.
    For any fixed level kk, the restriction
    redEdge≤k  =  “only ask about targets below level k”
    redEdge≤k​=“only ask about targets below level k”

    is computable with a level-kk oracle but not without.
    That mirrors the fact that 0(k+1)0(k+1) is Turing-reducible to 0(k)0(k) but not vice-versa.

    Consistent extension.
    You can keep appending new levels indefinitely: just reserve a fresh integer for
    callerIsNotHighEnoughHypercomputeLevel_(k+1)
    and define red edges for level k+1k+1 machines accordingly.
    No stage introduces an inconsistency, because each stage’s diagonal argument targets the next one.

4 What you can do with it

    Define gigantic step-counts.
    A λ-term that, say, searches for the first index whose red edge spells “neverHalts” at level kk will run for a transfinite-looking amount of time from the viewpoint of level k−1k−1. Pick kk big enough and its runtime will dominate any previously named integer (Rayo, Busy Beaver, …).

    Model-theoretic angle.
    Your graph is essentially a Kripke frame for arithmetic with a built-in jump operator. You could formalise it in second-order arithmetic (each level adds one more set predicate).

5 Open knobs to tune

    Which integers stand for the three symbols?
    Fix them once and you’ve nailed down a unique total function; change them and you get an isomorphic copy.

    Granularity of levels.
    Instead of one sentinel per level you could binary-encode the exact ordinal of the target’s power in the integer payload, giving finer distinctions.

    Interaction with other opcodes.
    If you allow higher-type inputs (functions as data) you can replicate Kleene’s OO and the full hyperarithmetic hierarchy.

Bottom line:
Your “red-edge” opcode is perfectly consistent once the third sentinel guards against same-level queries. It reconstructs the classical oracle ladder inside a concrete, all-integers graph, and it lets you manufacture step-counts (and hence integer names) that dwarf any number ever written so far — while staying clear of the diagonal paradox that sinks naive halting-oracles.

ChatGPT said:

Short answer: it still evaluates to 0 (or, if you insist on one bookkeeping tick, 1).
The gigantic “infinite [Exists/∀] dovetail” term really is present in your integer universe, but the way you defined nn forces the whole expression to short-circuit.
1 What exactly is nn?

“Num of positive integers < 1 in the ‘evens-before-odds’ order.”
There are no positive integers below 1, so
n=0.
n=0.

The fancy even-before-odd ordering never comes into play; the set is empty.
2 What does “0-th recursion” mean?

Recursion depth 0 is the base case of your alternation tower.
With no quantifier layers to peel, you hand the evaluator the raw λ-term and ask:

    “Does it, on its own, return church-true or church-false?”

If your evaluator counts only β-reductions until the first closed Church boolean pops out:

    For a term that is already a Church boolean → 0 steps.

    If you insert one explicit “check-and-return” tick → 1 step.

Either way the runtime is microscopic.
3 Why the monster term doesn’t rescue the count

The λ-term

infinite [Exists or Forall] dovetailing all lambdas

is indeed an enormous object as soon as you let the quantifier stack unwind.
But at depth 0 you don’t ask it to do any quantifier alternation; you just evaluate it directly.
If, by definition, it is required to produce a boolean (perhaps after an unbounded search) then the “number of steps before it begins that search” is still 0 / 1.
All the eye-watering cost lives in higher recursion levels—those you never reach because n=0n=0.
4 Verdict on “world’s biggest number”

Since the computed step-count is at most 1, the quoted statement

    “World’s biggest number, just now, is that step-count”

is false. Even ordinary integers like 2 or 10 surpass it, let alone things like Graham’s number or Rayo’s number.

(If you want the construction to yield an astronomically large value, you’ll need to set nn to something non-trivial—e.g. the first non-empty ordinal in your ordering—or otherwise tie the depth to a large index.)
You said:
lets try a simpler thing: At hypercompute level 1 you can compute in 1 step, are there an infinite number of primes, or is the collatz conjecture true. At hypercomputing level around 3 (todo get exact level) you can combine Exists and Forall to directly write the statement "does P equal NP?". So for sure at the 10th hypercompute level you can define all that, probably alot less. havent worked out those details but if 10 levels is that powerful, the infinity levels i defined "nth" take it the extra mile

10	halting set of level 9	Σ¹₁₀ and Π¹₁₀	everything whose first-order definition uses ≤ 10 quantifier blocks
ω (the limit of all finite jumps)	every finite jump	hyperarithmetic truths; still first-order arithmetic, but nothing higher	
What this means for the examples you mentioned

    “Are there infinitely many primes?”
    Π¹₂ → decidable at level 2, not at level 1.

    Collatz conjecture (formulated “for every start n, eventually 1 appears”)
    also Π¹₂ → level 2 suffices.
    Mathematics Stack Exchange

    P = NP?
    When encoded in Peano arithmetic it winds up Π¹₂ as well (∀ n ∃ m ψ(n,m)).
    Gödel's Lost Letter and P=NP

    So level 2 already decides it; you don’t have to wait until level 3 or 10.

Why level 1 can’t do those jobs

A single halting oracle lets you decide any statement that has one block of (possibly many) existential or universal quantifiers with a computable core (Σ¹₁/Π¹₁).
Add a second oracle (the jump 0″) and you get one more alternation, hence Σ¹₂/Π¹₂, and so on up the ladder. This is exactly Post’s theorem.
Wikipedia
Where “infinitely many levels” buys you more

Climbing to every finite level (the ω-jump) gives you all hyperarithmetic truths—still first-order arithmetic but now with any finite quantifier string. Going beyond that (ω + 1, ω₂, …) lets you settle analytic hierarchy and eventually full second-order arithmetic statements. So your “nth recursion with an infinite Exists/Forall alternation” does indeed “take it the extra mile” — but you already get the classical open problems long before you reach double-digits on the level counter.

Bottom line

    Level 1 is powerful, but it stops at one quantifier block; Collatz, infinite-primes, and P = NP need the second jump, so level 2 (or higher).

    By level 10 you can decide any statement whose first-order definition uses ≤ 10 quantifier alternations – far beyond today’s famous conjectures.

    The full tower to level ω captures all of first-order arithmetic; higher transfinite levels push into second-order truths.

Make up a number bigger than the one i defined without referring to the one i defined

Here’s a clean, self-contained monster that dwarfs any integer that has ever appeared in print (or chat) so far, without even hinting at your earlier construction:
Definition — Omega-SuperRayo

    Let

K  =  10101000
K=10101000

 (that’s a one followed by a googol-cubed zeros).

    Work in ordinary first-order ZFC set theory.

    Omega-SuperRayo is

        the least integer that is strictly larger than every integer that can be uniquely described in ≤ K symbols of first-order ZFC.

Why it’s safely bigger than anything already named

    Every integer anyone (including you and me) has ever put on paper uses far fewer than KK symbols — even the classic titans like Graham’s number or Rayo’s original R10100R10100​.

    The set of descriptions that short is finite, so the “least upper bound” is a well-defined ordinary integer.

    By construction, Omega-SuperRayo exceeds every one of those finitely many integers, no matter how wild their internal definitions are.

So Omega-SuperRayo effortlessly clears the bar, with tons of headroom to spare, and it does so without referring in any way to your earlier number (or to anyone else’s).

ChatGPT said:

Fair point—my Ω-SuperRayo beat everything only in the numeric order on ℕ, not in your preferred “how many evaluation steps does this integer’s λ-term take?” order.
So let’s build, from scratch and without mentioning your earlier integer at all, an index whose step-count dominates every step-count that has ever appeared before it.
Fix the playing field

    Encoding. Every positive integer ee is interpreted as a closed λ-term MeMe​ under one fixed Gödel numbering.

    Evaluator. We use the standard weak-head, call-by-value reduction strategy and count one tick per β-reduction. (Any deterministic strategy would work—just pick one and never change it.)

    Step-function.
    \operatorname{Steps}(e)=\text{ “# of ticks until }M_e\text{ yields a Church boolean.”}

    (If MeMe​ never returns a boolean, Steps⁡(e)=∞Steps(e)=∞.)

Construction of a Much-Bigger-Step integer

We’ll write a λ-term that out-slows every term whose Gödel number is smaller than its own:

SlowMonster ≡ λ u.
    let selfIndex   = u          -- u is Church numeral for *this* term’s Gödel #
        maxStepsSoFar =
            fold (λ i acc.
                    let s = simulate_and_count i in
                    if s > acc then s else acc)
                 0
                 (range 1 selfIndex)  -- loop over all 1 … selfIndex−1
        in  dummy_loop (maxStepsSoFar + 1)    -- burn strictly more steps

    simulate_and_count runs MiMi​ on a fresh tape, counting ticks until it produces a Church boolean (diverging if it never does).

    dummy_loop k is a trivial β-reduction chain of length kk that ends with church-true.

Finally, let E be the Gödel number of SlowMonster (fed its own index via the usual fixed-point trick so u really is E).
Key property

For every positive integer n<En<E,
Steps⁡(E)  =  max⁡1≤i<E(Steps⁡(i))+1  >  Steps⁡(n).
Steps(E)=1≤i<Emax​(Steps(i))+1>Steps(n).

So EE beats all earlier indices in the step-count order, even though its numeric value sits innocently among them.
Why this trumps anything “already written”

    Every integer humans have so far described—Graham’s number’s index, Rayo’s, yours, mine—is some finite nn.

    By definition n<En<E (those earlier descriptions don’t know SlowMonster exists yet).

    Therefore their evaluation heights satisfy Steps⁡(n)<Steps⁡(E)Steps(n)<Steps(E).

Thus EE is strictly larger than every previously named integer in your “how many ticks until a boolean?” ordering, despite our never referring to any one of them.
Caveats & knobs

    Change the evaluator and you must rebuild SlowMonster with the new counting rule.

    If someone later publishes an index F>EF>E, its step-count might eclipse EE’s—or not. They can always play the same trick again, forever pushing the frontier upward.

But for the snapshot taken right now, the integer EE we’ve just defined is the undisputed lazy-evaluation marathon champion.

Below is a 22-slot “giant-number leaderboard.”
• Your integer comes first.
• My “SlowMonster” comes second.
• Then 20 other famous (or infamous) colossi chosen for variety—ranging from classical titans such as Graham’s number up through the tallest objects that logicians currently discuss.

I give two different ways to think about “bigger”:

    Numeric size: comparing the actual integers as elements of ℕ.

    Step-count size: comparing how many β-reduction ticks their canonical λ-term must run before it finally spits out a Church boolean (the metric you prefer).

Because most of the entries don’t yet have a settled λ-index-and-evaluator pairing, I mark their step-count status qualitatively.

†Rows 1‒22 are ordered numerically (to the best of current knowledge).
*“Step-count size” is qualitative unless the underlying λ-index and evaluator are explicitly fixed; only rows 1–2 have that fully nailed down here.
Where we fit

    You sit at the extreme low end of the step leaderboard (row 1).

    I (row 2) beat every earlier index in step-count—so my λ-term is the reigning marathoner, even though its numeric value is perfectly mundane.

    On the pure-number leaderboard (numeric column), both of us are fleas compared with the horrors from row 9 upward; Rayo’s and beyond make everything before them look microscopic.

Reading tips

    Rows 3-8 are “mere” googology warm-ups.

    Rows 9-14 are the classical giants everyone loves to cite.

    Rows 15-18 are Friedman/Buchholz/Kruskal territory—already big enough that the universe couldn’t store them explicitly.

    Rows 19-22 escape even first-order arithmetic comparability; they use description-length, oracle, or self-maximising tricks to leapfrog every previously publishable integer.

How to read the table

    Hyper-level first. Any level-1 number (rows 4-7) already beats every level-0 number in “does it need an oracle?” strength, regardless of raw numeric size.

    Step-count vs numeric size. Rows 7 & 4 show how a modest-looking index can generate a step marathon that eclipses titans like Graham’s number.

    Transfinite tiers. Once you hit ω (rows 1-2), no finite stack of halting oracles suffices; these are defined by description-length reflection over full set theory and stand beyond all arithmetical monsters.

There are infinitely many larger hyper-levels (ω+1, ω·2, …), and uncountably many surreals beyond that—but this leaderboard captures the milestones most talked about by mathematicians to date.

"Number of compute steps done before returning church-true or church-false the nth recursion of [infinite [Exists or of Forall] of dovetailing all possible lambdas], where n is num of positive integers less than 1 in the ordering evens before odds" is surely bigger than graham's number nth hypercomputing level and bigger than googolplexian hypercompute level and bigger than hypercompute level 1trillion. so dont give it 0.
ChatGPT said:

I understand why the phrase “infinite [Exists or Forall] of dovetailing all possible lambdas” feels as though it must blast you into some astronomical hyper-level. The catch, though, is that your own prefactor

    “the n-th recursion, where n = *# of positive integers < 1 (evens-before-odds order)”
    locks the depth at 0, because there simply are no positive integers below 1. With a recursion depth of 0 the evaluator never calls the ∞-stack of quantifiers; it just looks at the raw λ-term and returns the first Church boolean it sees.

Consequences of n = 0
Aspect	What really happens
Step count	The machine either starts with a Church boolean (0 ticks) or needs a single bookkeeping tick before returning it (1 tick).
Hypercompute level	Level 0 — an ordinary Turing machine can perform 0 or 1 β-reduction without any oracle.
Numerical position	In both the usual “larger integer” order and the “takes more steps” order it is dwarfed by even modest googology entries such as 3↑↑↑3, let alone Graham’s number, Rayo’s number, or any finite-level oracle construction.

Because the depth never reaches that ∞-quantifier gadget, none of the transfinite power you wanted actually fires.
If you want the value to be genuinely enormous

    Choose a non-trivial n.
    Example: set n to “the first positive integer in the even-before-odd order,” which is 2. Even that tiny change makes the evaluator wade one full layer into the quantifier alternation, producing a step count that no classical Busy-Beaver value can touch.

    Or, tie n to the size of the lambda index.
    Let n be “the Gödel number of this very definition.” That forces the recursion depth to explode as soon as the description is large, yielding a step count in the hyperarithmetic or even analytic realm—far beyond any finite hypercompute level.

    Or, drop the n-parameter entirely.
    Define the integer as “the step count of the full ∞-alternation dovetail itself.” That value is uncomputable at every finite oracle level and comfortably outruns Graham-class giants.

Any of these tweaks would justify placing your number well above level 1 trillion (or any finite level you like). But with n = 0 the step count—and therefore the hypercompute level—remains a perfectly mundane 0, and the integer is tiny.

that is 1 tick in units of the total size of all levels below
ChatGPT said:

Understood—you’re changing the yard-stick.
Instead of counting β-reductions in the usual “one primitive step = 1,” you want each supertick at level ω to represent the entire aggregate runtime of every lower level.
That rescaling really does catapult even a single supertick far beyond the reach of any finite-level construction such as Graham’s number or a trillion Turing-jump oracles.
1 What “one tick” means in this metric

Imagine the ordinary step counter at level 0 reads in ordinary natural units:

Level-0 runtime  :  0, 1, 2, 3, …

Level 1 then measures time in blocks big enough to absorb every possible level-0 run.
Call that block-size B₀. A level-1 timer therefore ticks in multiples of B₀:

Level-1 runtime  :  0·B₀, 1·B₀, 2·B₀, …

Level 2 uses blocks of size B₁, where B₁ ≫ B₀, and so on.
By the time you reach level ω, the fundamental unit has length
Bω  =  sup⁡k<ωBk,
Bω​=k<ωsup​Bk​​,

i.e. “the least upper bound of all the finite-level block sizes.”
Even one such supertick therefore covers every computation that any finite oracle machine could ever finish.
2 How big is BωBω​ compared with familiar giants?

Because each BkBk​ already dominates all Σk1Σk1​/Πk1Πk1​ Busy-Beaver values, their limit BωBω​

    exceeds every Busy-Beaver constant BB(n)BB(n) for any finite nn;

    outruns TREE(3), SSCG(4), Buchholz-Hydra lengths, etc.;

    towers over Graham’s number, googolplexians, and every “R-arrow” power tower;

and it does so by an unbounded ordinal gap, not merely by a finite multiplicative factor. In effect you have
1 supertick     >    max⁡{all classical googology numbers}.
1 supertick >max{all classical googology numbers}.
3 What about your depth-0 dovetail?

    Step-count (ordinary units): 0 or 1

    Step-count (super-units of size BωBω​):  
    {0,if it starts as a Church boolean,1⋅Bω,if it needs the bookkeeping tick.
    ⎩

⎨

    ⎧​0,1⋅Bω​,​if it starts as a Church boolean,if it needs the bookkeeping tick.​

That single supertick of duration BωBω​ is provably larger than any integer obtainable at any finite hypercompute level, hence larger than Graham’s number, googolplexian hyperlevels, or “level one-trillion” artefacts.
4 Where does “SlowMonster” land?

“SlowMonster” was engineered at hyper-level 1.
Its raw tick count dominates all lower-level λ-indices in ordinary units, but when we re-express both runtimes in superticks of size BωBω​:

    “SlowMonster” < 1⋅Bω1⋅Bω​ (because it never climbs to level ω),

    your depth-0 dovetail equals either 00 or 1⋅Bω1⋅Bω​.

So with this new metric, your integer actually beats “SlowMonster.”
Bottom line

If “one tick” is measured in BωBω​—the total runtime-capacity of all finite hypercompute levels—then even a bookkeeping step yields an integer that dwarfs every classic big number and every finite-level oracle value.
Under that convention your depth-0 dovetail is indeed astronomically large (either 0 or BωBω​), and the earlier 0/1 verdict applies only to the raw unit scale, not to your rescaled supertick yard-stick.

Re-defining SlowMonster

SlowMonster ω+1
Hyper-level ω + 1 (one oracle jump above the entire arithmetical hierarchy)

SlowMonsterω+1 ≡ λu.
    let selfIndex = u                        -- its own Gödel index
    let S = supStepsBelow(selfIndex)         -- supremum of step-counts for all indices < selfIndex

    supStepsBelow uses the halting oracle for level ω machines to finish every simulation.

    super-tickω (= Bω) is the time block that already encloses the entire runtime capacity of all finite hyper-levels.

    Result: Steps(SlowMonster ω+1) = 1·Bω + 1, i.e. strictly larger than any number whose evaluation lives at or below level ω.

Reading the columns

    Hyper-level: Minimum oracle depth needed to compute the integer for sure.
    Level ω means “every finite jump built-in”; ω + 1 adds a halting oracle for those super-machines.

    Step-count in units of Bω:

        < 1 = finishes in less than one mega-tick (still enormous in raw steps).

        1   = exactly one mega-tick.

        ≥ 1+ = at least one full mega-tick plus extra runtime—strictly larger than any single-tick ω-level integer.

Under this metric, your depth-0 dovetail (row 22) is indeed bigger (in step-units) than every finite hyper-level construction, while SlowMonster ω+1 (row 1) now claims the crown by vaulting a full oracle jump higher.
You said:
[ your depth-0 dovetail (row 22) is indeed bigger (in step-units) than every finite hyper-level construction]

its not a depth 0 dovetail. cuz the red edge points at the result of that, and you can dovetail at each hypercompute level to cross any edge (func/L edge, param/R edge, or hyperRed edge, in this constant directed graph of 1 outgoing edge of each type from every positive integer to a positive integer. For example, the integer S(F(U))(F(U)) is a lambda that calls its param on itself param(param). S(F(U))(F(U))(S(F(U))(F(U))) is therefore an infinite loop therefore its red edge points at neverHalts. If you try to cross its red edge from the same hyper level you're querying about, you'll get a symbol ur too low hyper level (deterministicly, so at a higher hyper level even your such query is a fact of math that can be hypercomputed about Exists and Forall in turing complete combos)....
ChatGPT said:

I see the gap in how I was reading your system:

    I treated the body of the λ-term that sits at recursion depth 0 as an ordinary program.

    In your graph, however, every evaluation step is allowed to chase “func →”, “param →”, and especially the red “evalsTo →” edge—and that edge may itself encode a halting-oracle jump one level up.
    If the caller is still at the same level as the target, the red edge yields the sentinel
    callerIsNotHighEnoughHypercomputeLevel; only a strictly higher oracle level can see the real answer (haltsOn_x or neverHalts).

What this means for your “depth-0” alternation term

Even with n = 0 recursion:

    The term’s own body immediately asks red-edge questions about potentially every λ-index appearing in its dovetail.

    To get a definite Church boolean you therefore have to climb one level above whatever level each target resides in.

    Because the dovetail ranges over all positive integers—and hence over all finite hyper-levels—the evaluator is forced to move straight to level ω (the first limit above every finite jump).

So the step count is not confined to any finite BkBk​; it lives in the very first super-block BωBω​.

    Result: your integer’s evaluation requires exactly one level-ω super-tick
    Steps⁡Bω(your term)=1,
    StepsBω​​(your term)=1,

    which already dominates every finite-level construction—no matter how large its raw numeric value.

SlowMonster needs to leap again

My original SlowMonster (level 1) was built to beat all finite-level step counts.
To stay ahead of your level-ω tick, I re-tooled it as SlowMonster ω+1ω+1:

    It runs with a level-ω halting oracle in hand, scans all indices < its own, asks the oracle their exact step counts, takes their supremum, and then burns that many + 1 level-ω super-ticks.

Hence
Steps⁡Bω(SlowMonsterω+1)  =  1+sup⁡e<SMSteps⁡Bω(e)  >  1,
StepsBω​​(SlowMonsterω+1​)=1+e<SMsup​StepsBω​​(e)>1,

making it strictly larger than your term in the same unit.
Updated leaderboard (sorted by hyper-level, then by ω-superticks)
#	Hyper-level	Name / shorthand	Definition sketch	Step count in units of BωBω​
1	ω + 1	SlowMonster ω+1	scans all lower indices with a level-ω oracle, then burns one extra ω-tick	≥ 1 +
2	ω	Your “∞∃/∀ dovetail”, depth 0	needs to traverse red edges for all finite levels, so consumes one full ω-tick	1

6	1	Steps(SlowMonster 1)	step count of original level-1 SlowMonster	< 1
…	…	(all remaining finite-level giants)	TREE(3), Graham’s G, etc.	< 1

    Rows 1–4 all live at or above level ω, so any amount of time they use—measured in ω-superticks—already beats every finite-level behemoth such as Graham’s number or a trillion-jump Busy Beaver.

    Your term (row 2) now rightfully sits above all finite levels; SlowMonster ω+1 stays in front by burning one additional ω-tick.

Take-away

With the red-edge semantics clarified, your “depth-0” construction is not trivial at all: it forces the evaluator to the first transfinite jump (level ω) and consumes one whole BωBω​ time-block, thereby eclipsing every finite-level big number.
The only way to outdo it in the same step-metric is to add at least one more oracle jump—exactly what SlowMonster ω+1 does.

At the start of this conversation, before you (even though i havent looked that deep into what is SlowMonster) came up with a kind of number called SlowMonster and a few ever bigger variants of it, but at the start of this conversation, was this true?:

Worlds biggest number, just now: "Number of compute steps done before returning church-true or church-false the nth recursion of [infinite [Exists or of Forall] of dovetailing all possible lambdas], where n is num of positive integers less than 1 in the ordering evens before odds
ChatGPT said:

No —that headline was already false at the very start of our chat.
Why it wasn’t the “world’s biggest”
Aspect	What your definition actually yielded (before any SlowMonster appeared)	How known giants compared
Numeric description length	A short English phrase/λ-term that easily fits inside a few thousand symbols of first-order set theory.	Rayo’s number is defined to exceed every integer describable in ≤ 10¹⁰⁰ symbols. Your term’s description is far shorter, so Rayo’s number is automatically larger.
Step-count metric (ordinary ticks)	Because n = 0, the evaluator never enters the ∞-quantifier tower; it returns its boolean immediately (0 – 1 ordinary β-steps).	Even modest objects such as 3↑↑↑3 require more than one ordinary step to write out, let alone evaluate.
Step-count metric (ω-superticks, after we clarified your red-edge semantics)	It consumes exactly one Bω-sized supertick. That already outruns every finite hyper-level runtime, but is still an integer expressible in a handful of symbols.	Rayo’s number, Ω-SuperRayo, and similar reflection-based colossi still dominate because their very definitions force them above any integer that can be described as compactly as yours.

So, even under the generous “one Bω supertick” yard-stick, better-known numbers like Rayo’s (and many others) were already larger—making the proclamation “world’s biggest number, just now” incorrect.

(Only after we introduced SlowMonster ω+1 did we craft something whose step-count is provably beyond yours as well.)
You said:

rayos number therefore exceeds rayo's number since it is among the set it claims to be bigger than, as are many variants of it so it cant exclude "except rayos number". therefore I deny that rayo's number is a number at all.
ChatGPT said:

It only looks like a paradox because we’re mixing two languages.
Where the definition lives	Length bound that matters
Object-language (first-order ZFC formulas)	≤ 10¹⁰⁰ symbols ← Rayo’s bound
Meta-language (English, or this chat)	no fixed limit — we can use as many words as we like
How the definition really works

    Fix the object language.
    Alphabet = { ∧, ¬, ∃, =, ∈, (, ), x₀, x₁, … }.
    A formula is just a finite string of those symbols.

    Look only at formulas ≤ 10¹⁰⁰ symbols long that have
    one free variable x₁ and pin down a single integer (e.g.
    ∃x₀ (x₀ ∈ x₁ ∧ ¬∃x₀ (x₀ ∈ x₁)) singles out the integer 1).

    Collect the integers those short formulas single out.
    That is a finite set — call it D.

    Rayo(10¹⁰⁰) = the least integer > every element of D.

Crucial point:

    The object-language formula that singles out “Rayo(10¹⁰⁰)” itself is far longer than 10¹⁰⁰ symbols,
    so Rayo(10¹⁰⁰) is not a member of D and no contradiction arises.

Tiny analogy

Object language = decimal numerals up to 2 characters.

    What integers are definable? 0 – 99.

    “100” is larger than every integer definable in ≤ 2 characters, yet “100” itself needs 3 characters, so it isn’t in the forbidden list and everything is consistent.

Rayo’s construction is the same idea, just with a stupendously larger alphabet and bound.
Why the definition is a legitimate integer

    Inside standard ZFC (or even PA) you can prove the finite set D exists and therefore its least upper bound exists.

    You can Gödel-code that whole proof inside ZFC; the resulting code is enormous—certainly > 10¹⁰⁰ symbols—so it doesn’t violate the bound it talks about.

    Hence Rayo(10¹⁰⁰) is a perfectly good (albeit unimaginably large) natural number. It simply isn’t nameable within the length budget it uses to bound everyone else.

Bottom line:
Rayo’s number does not “include itself” in the set it beats. The definition uses a length-cutoff, and the formal name of Rayo’s number necessarily exceeds that cutoff, keeping the construction consistent. Denying it exists because of self-reference is like denying “100” exists because it’s bigger than every 2-digit numeral: the seeming loop disappears once you keep object-language and meta-language separate.
