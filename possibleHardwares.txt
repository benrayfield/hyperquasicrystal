The lambdas will run in any software, such as javascript, java, python, but could also be optimized in some existing or new specialized hardware.
What possible kinds of hardware might be efficient?...

Possibly existing cellular automata chips, manifold based hardware, GPUs, cellprocessors, etc, or simply javascript in a browser but much slower.

All liquid quasicrystal chips would run on a very low energy 3d clock wave or vibration.

* The first chip should be just a proof of concept, not do much useful (but smaller variants of it might be useful as a RAM or flash memory stick,
todo explore later, this one is just to get a feel for how liquid quasicrystals work).

where each cell has 5 bits of state for is it white/black and is there a langtonsAnt in each of 4 directions.
This is unitary and quickly reversible. Langtons Ant is said to be turing complete but I'm not sure if it is. Its at least interestingly chaotic.

* The third 3d liquid quasicrystal chip should do matrix multiply faster than most GPUs, and is reversible though not solvable in reverse,
using this way of swapping 2 bits for 1 bit: https://sourceforge.net/projects/visualintfactor/

* The fourth 3d liquid quasicrystal chip should take some representation of an energy function that describes a sparse graph (edges between nodes),
and carry pointers between graph nodes along 3d paths between them. These graph shapes are of just 1 constant graph shape,
that does not change from earlier cycles to later cycles, but instead near-statelessly navigates a constant infinite size math structure
such as the space of all possible lambda functions being represented as such a graph.
Some kind of vibration or way of the 3d path pointers, not blobbing into eachother, but still being able to cross eachother without tangling,
would need to be figured out. Garbage collection in a constant infinite size math structure is simply to delete any graph edge or node
at any time because it can be deterministicly derived again.

* After combining various of those kinds of liquid quasicrystals, explore possible liquid quasicrystal physics theories of what
the planck scale is made of. Probaby we are a 3d quasicrystal, and microscopic wormholes aka quantum foam are similar to pointers,
or something like that.

When I say liquid quasicrystal, I mean an actual liquid, that could be poured from a bottle.
